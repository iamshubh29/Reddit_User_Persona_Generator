# Reddit User Persona Generator

## Project Description

This project provides a Python-based solution to automatically generate detailed user personas from a Reddit user's public profile. It achieves this by scraping their comments and posts and then leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) – specifically Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash – to extract key persona characteristics and provide direct citations from the Reddit content.

**To use it, you will execute a command like `python main.py https://www.reddit.com/user/username/` in your terminal.** The script will then process the user's data, generate a persona, and automatically **store the generated `.txt` file directly in the `output/` folder** within your project directory. A sample output file, generated by this script, is also included for reference.

The goal is to automate the process of understanding a user's interests, personality, goals, and online behavior based on their public Reddit activity, complete with traceable evidence for each inferred trait.

## How It Works (The Process)

The application follows a systematic pipeline when executed from the terminal:

1.  **Input Collection:** You provide a Reddit user profile URL directly as a command-line argument when running the script.
2.  **Data Scraping:** Utilizing the **PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)** library, the application connects to the Reddit API. It then efficiently scrapes the most recent public comments and posts associated with the provided Reddit user profile.
3.  **Content Preparation:** The scraped textual data (comments and post bodies/titles) is consolidated and prepared for analysis by the Large Language Model.
4.  **LLM Persona Generation:** The prepared text data is sent to **Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash LLM**. A carefully crafted prompt guides the LLM to analyze the content and identify various aspects of the user's persona, including:
    * A Suggested Name for the persona.
    * Inferred demographic details like Age and Occupation.
    * Their key Interests & Hobbies.
    * Dominant Personality Traits.
    * Underlying Goals & Motivations.
    * Common Pain Points & Challenges.
    * Observed Online Behavior patterns.
5.  **Citing Evidence:** A crucial part of the LLM's task is to provide **direct citations** for each persona characteristic. This means for every trait identified, the LLM will either quote the exact Reddit comment/post content and its URL that supports the inference, or explicitly state "Inferred from general activity" if the trait is a broader conclusion. This ensures transparency and traceability of the generated persona.
6.  **Output to File:** The complete, formatted user persona (including all characteristics and their citations) is automatically saved as a `.txt` file within a dedicated `output/` folder inside your project directory. The filename will be based on the Reddit username (e.g., `kojied_persona.txt`).

## Features

* **Command-Line Input:** Takes a Reddit user profile URL directly as a command-line argument.
    * Example: `python main.py https://www.reddit.com/user/kojied/`
* **Robust Data Scraping:** Efficiently scrapes public comments and posts using the PRAW library, handling Reddit API interactions.
* **Intelligent Persona Generation:** Leverages Google Gemini 1.5 Flash LLM for nuanced understanding and synthesis of user data into a structured persona.
* **Transparent Citations:** Each persona characteristic is backed by direct quotes/links from Reddit content or clearly marked as inferred, providing verifiable insights.
* **Direct File Output:** Automatically saves the generated persona as a `.txt` file in the `output/` directory (e.g., `kojied_persona.txt`) for easy access.

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3.8+**: The core programming language for the project.
* **PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)**: For programmatic access to Reddit's API to scrape user comments and posts.
* **Google Generative AI**: The official Python client library for interacting with Google's Gemini LLM.
* **`python-dotenv`**: For securely managing API keys and other sensitive environment variables.
